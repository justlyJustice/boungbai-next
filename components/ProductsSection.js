              <p>
                MonitorMe is a web-app built out of the need to bridge trust
                between Project Host Communities, Contracting Firms and Project
                awarding Agencies/Institutes. Especially, in developing
                countries where corruption is inevitable; contracts are awarded
                by government, international organizations, NGOs and other
                bodies but most of these jobs donâ€™t see the light of day. What
                happens is, contracting firms take snap-shots of similar
                projects elsewhere and forward the same as completed projects
                and in most of the cases, the poor host communities are not
                aware of such projects.

                There have always been ways of supervising projects/contracts
                globally ranging from questionable reports from contracting
                firms, telephone conversations, unreliable snap-shots from
                contracting firms, un-scheduled visits by agencies which is very
                rear and many considers it as a waste of time and resources. In
                all these, there has been in no time the entire community/public
                has been carried along in their own development which MonitorMe
                addresses.

                MonitorMe can be adopted to both small and big project
                monitoring needs of any organisation. This implies that this
                solution can scale to meet the need of
                organisations/institutions of any kind with projects that reach
                a very wide population.

              <p>
                MonitorMe implementation depends on the terms of agreement
                between our company and the agency. We offer to train personnel
                from the agency who will administer the day-to-day running of
                the App. Our contacts are always on for any complain and also
                for upgrades. In a situation where the agency wants us to manage
                MonitorMe; we also oblige. In terms of payment the agency does
                that and we are very affordable. We also hope to get donations
                from the private sector, governments, international donors and
                non-profit organisations to enable us run a publicly managed
                version of the solution without any particular organisation
                anchoring it.
